We are making a collaborative soundboard web app based off an infinite canvas layout. 

Keep things simple and very modular.

Start with the basic infinite canvas. Users should be able to pan and place down two items: soundboard buttons and text boxes. Once placed, these two items should be movable. Text boxes should be editable, and soundboard buttons should be able to capture mic input.



expand the music bubbles a bit
- labels: editable textbox below each bubble
- sounds should be async so you can trigger a button more than once and have sounds overlap
- properties: should display as smaller bubbles next to each sound bubble
  - keyboard hotkey: auto-generated for each bubble, and can edit
  - filters 
    - slowed 
    - reverb
    - reversed
    - nightcore (faster + pitch corrected)
