Soundboard web-app for those phrases you and your friends just can't get out of your heads.

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start dev server (with auto-rebuild on changes)
bun run dev

# Build for production
bun run build
```

The dev server runs at `http://localhost:3000` and automatically rebuilds when you change any files in `src/`, `index.html`, or `styles.css`.
